# [BORN](http://julianmendez.github.io/born/)
*Bayesian Ontology Reasoner*


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/julianmendez/born.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/julianmendez/born)


**BORN** is a probabilistic reasoner for BEL (Bayesian EL), which is an extension of the
lightweight [Description Logic](http://dl.kr.org/) EL. Bayesian Ontology Languages are a
family of probabilistic ontology languages that allow to encode probabilistic information
over the axioms of an ontology with the help of a Bayesian network. BORN uses
the [OWL API](http://owlcs.github.io/owlapi/) to
read [OWL 2 EL](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#OWL_2_EL) ontologies.
